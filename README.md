# Welcome
This repository has code to explore a few possible neural network models for the sample data provided by edX that explores charity campaigns and if they met their goals
## Contents
In this repo, you will find two notebook files.
</br>
- The "AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb" file is the initial model using some base parameters.
- The "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb" file has 3 more models with slightly different parameters to see if we could get higher accuracy
- "h5_files" is a folder containing the 4 models referenced above saved as h5 files
- "Checkpoints" folder contains checkpoints from the initial model fit in "AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb"

## Analysis
Finally in the "nn-report.md" you will find a comparison of the models and their accuracy outcome.
